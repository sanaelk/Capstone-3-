# Heart Disease Risk Classification - Final Report

## Executive Summary
This project developed a machine learning model to predict heart disease risk using clinical measurements. The model achieved 86% accuracy in identifying patients at risk, providing a tool that could help healthcare providers identify high-risk individuals earlier.

## 1. Problem Statement
Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Early identification of at-risk individuals can significantly improve outcomes through timely intervention. This project aimed to answer: **Can we accurately predict heart disease risk using routine clinical measurements?**

## 2. Data Overview
- **Dataset**: UCI Heart Disease Dataset (Cleveland subset)
- **Samples**: 303 patient records
- **Features**: 13 clinical measurements
- **Target**: Heart disease presence (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Balance**: 54% no disease, 46% with disease (fairly balanced)

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Data Preparation
- Handled categorical features (chest pain type, ECG results, etc.)
- Scaled numerical features to consistent ranges
- Split data: 70% training, 30% testing

### 3.2 Models Tested
Three models were developed and compared:
1. **Logistic Regression** (Baseline model)
2. **Random Forest Classifier**
3. **Gradient Boosting Classifier**

### 3.3 Model Selection
The Random Forest model performed best and was selected for final implementation after hyperparameter tuning.

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Final Model Performance
| Metric | Score | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Accuracy | 86.8% | Correct predictions |
| Precision | 84.2% | When predicting disease, 84% actually have it |
| Recall | 89.1% | Identifies 89% of actual disease cases |
| F1-Score | 0.866 | Balance of precision and recall |
| ROC-AUC | 0.868 | Good discrimination ability |

### 4.2 Key Insights from the Model

**Most Important Features:**
1. **thalach** - Maximum heart rate achieved
2. **oldpeak** - ST depression induced by exercise
3. **cp** - Type of chest pain
4. **ca** - Number of major vessels
5. **thal** - Thalassemia test result

**What This Means:**
- Exercise test results (heart rate, ST depression) are strong predictors
- Chest pain characteristics are highly informative
- Cardiac imaging results (vessel count) matter

**Impact**: Early identification could reduce severe outcomes

## 7. Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations:
1. Dataset size is relatively small (303 patients)
2. Limited to Cleveland data only
3. No time-series data (single time point measurements)

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Add Time-Series Data**: Track patient vitals over time
2. **Expand Dataset**: Include more diverse patient populations
3. **Clinical Integration**: Develop user-friendly interface for doctors

## 8. Conclusion
This project successfully developed a heart disease prediction model with 87% accuracy using routine clinical measurements. The model highlights the importance of exercise testing and chest pain assessment in early detection. While not a replacement for medical diagnosis, it can serve as a valuable screening tool to identify high-risk patients who need further evaluation.

    THE STORY IN THE DATA: What We Learned About Heart Disease Prediction

THE PROBLEM:
Heart disease affects millions, but early detection is challenging. Doctors need tools to identify high-risk patients before serious symptoms appear.

OUR APPROACH:
We analyzed 303 patient records with 13 routine measurements (age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.) to build a prediction model.

KEY FINDINGS:

1. EXERCISE MATTERS MOST
   The strongest predictors came from exercise tests:
   - Maximum heart rate during exercise
   - ST segment depression (shows heart stress)
   This tells us: How the heart performs under stress is more revealing than resting measurements.

2. CHEST PAIN TELLS A STORY
   The type of chest pain was the 3rd most important feature.
   Not all chest pain is equal - specific types are stronger indicators of heart disease.

3. SIMPLE MEASUREMENTS = GOOD PREDICTIONS
   With just routine clinical data (no expensive tests), we achieved 87% accuracy.
   This means: Primary care doctors could use this as a screening tool.

THE MODEL'S PERFORMANCE:
- Correctly identifies 89% of true heart disease cases
- Only 13% false positive rate (avoids unnecessary alarm)
- Balanced performance - good at finding disease AND confirming health

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR PATIENTS:
1. Regular exercise testing could save lives
2. Pay attention to chest pain characteristics
3. Routine check-ups with these measurements provide valuable risk assessment

NEXT STEPS:
While this model performs well, adding time-series data (tracking measurements over months) could make it even better at spotting early warning signs.

THE BOTTOM LINE:
We can predict heart disease risk with good accuracy using measurements already collected in routine check-ups. This tool could help doctors focus attention on the patients who need it most.
